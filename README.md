# Lab Website

This repository will host the official website for the [Lab Name] (placeholder). The site presents our research, people, publications, projects, news, and information for prospective students and collaborators.

## Overview

Purpose: provide a professional, discoverable online presence for the lab that showcases our work, publishes news and events, and helps recruit students and collaborators.

Audience: researchers, students, funders, collaborators, and the public.

## Goals

- Clearly present lab mission and research areas
- Showcase people (faculty, postdocs, students) with short bios and contact links
- List publications, software, datasets, and projects with filters/tags
- Publish news, announcements, and events
- Provide resources for prospective students and collaborators
- Make the site easy to maintain and deploy

## Planned pages / sections

- Home / Hero with key messages
- Research (areas, groups, projects)
- People (profiles for faculty, postdocs, students, alumni)
- Publications (searchable / filterable list)
- Projects / Software / Datasets (links, badges, status)
- News & Events (blog-style posts)
- Join / Opportunities (open positions, instructions to apply)
- Contact & Location
- About / Acknowledgements / Funding

## Tech stack (suggested)

- Static site generator: Next.js, Hugo, or Jekyll (TBD)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS or plain CSS variables
- Content: Markdown files for posts/pages, or a headless CMS for non-technical editors
- Deployment: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
- CI: GitHub Actions for build and deploy

Note: the repository currently contains only this README; chosen stack and architecture will be documented once selected.

## Development setup (example)

The exact commands will depend on the chosen stack. Example for a Node.js + Next.js site:

1. Install Node.js (LTS) and npm or pnpm
2. Install dependencies:

	npm install

3. Run the dev server:

	npm run dev

4. Build for production:

	npm run build

5. Preview production build:

	npm run start

Adjust commands for your package manager and chosen framework.

## Content workflow

- Content will be stored as Markdown under a `content/` or `posts/` folder, or managed through a headless CMS.
- Profile data for people can be stored in structured YAML/JSON frontmatter for easy rendering.
- Publications can be imported from a bibtex file or managed manually as Markdown with metadata.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork or branch from `main`.
2. Add or update content and tests.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes.
4. A maintainer will review and merge.

Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` when the site structure is finalized.

## License

Decide on a license for the website assets and code (e.g., MIT for code, CC-BY for content). Add a `LICENSE` file at repo root.

## Contact

For questions about the website, reach out to the lab PI or site maintainers (add email/contact page once available).

## Next steps

1. Choose the static site generator and tech stack.
2. Scaffold the site (starter template, routing, and base styling).
3. Add content skeletons: people, publications, projects, and news.
4. Add CI for build + deploy to the chosen host.

If you want, I can scaffold a starter site (Next.js + Tailwind + sample pages) in this repo and add scripts to build and run it locally â€” tell me which stack you prefer and I'll create the project files.
